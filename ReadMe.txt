This is a ReadMe file which guides the users to execute the functionalities of our program.

i. Compilation information- 
+ Firstly we need to run the following statement, "export CLASSPATH=/usr/lib/oracle/19.8/client64/lib/ojdbc8.jar:${CLASSPATH}". This exports the class pathrequired for our program.
+ An efficient strategy that one should follow is get all the required files, DeletionHandler.java, InsertionHandler.java, UpdateHandler.java, Utility.java, QueryHandler.java and
  Frontend.java into a particular folder, say 460finalproject. 
+ Then we should run the statement, "javac *.java" while being inside the 460finalproject folder. 
+ After that the user can run the Frontend file by typing the statement, "java Frontend".
+ The user can leave the Frontend by typing exit. The user can type back to go to the previous section.
+ The user can appropriately use the program to handle the database.

ii. Workload distribution- 
Minh - insertions, deletions, queries, Normalisation Analysis, Utility and Frontend structures.

Soumay - back end (create tables, assertions, FK references, initial data population), Update and Relational Schema.
